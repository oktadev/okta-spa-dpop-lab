# Okta SPA DPoP Lab

This project runs the SPA DPoP lab using Angular and Okta client SDKs.

In this lab, you'll see how Demonstrating Proof of Possession protects you from unauthorized access token use. You'll call Okta APIs and watch network requests to see the difference with your code changes.

## Get going

Open the project in GitHub Codespaces. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
