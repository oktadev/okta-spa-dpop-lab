Get ready to:\n  1. Simulate unauthorized calls to your Okta org using a Bearer token\n  2. Enable DPoP in Okta and the app\n  3. Simulate unauthorized calls again to see the protection mechanism at work\n  \nFeel free to ask questions and let us know if you need help. Let's get coding! 💻"

You'll need a browser with good developer tooling, such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. We've tailored the instructions for Chrome.\n\n**Token assurance and code assurance**\n\nAs you make code changes, the instructions will have you run an automated test script to double-check your work. Testing FTW! 🏆"

      "description": "## Configure the OIDC app integration in Okta\n\nYou need to enter information about your Codespace in the settings. Then, you'll run a command that outputs values to the Codespace terminal and paste those values within Okta.\n\nPress [this link to write the Codespace URL to the terminal](command:codetour.sendTextToTerminal?[\"echo https://$CODESPACE_NAME-4200.app.github.dev\"]). Copy the URL that prints in the terminal. \n>Note this runs the following command: `echo https://${CODESPACE_NAME}-4200.app.github.dev`.\n\n➡️ **Copy this URL. You'll need it in the next steps.** ⬅️\n\n### Okta Admin Console configuration\n\nNavigate back to the Okta Admin Console tab. You need to add the Codespace URI as a trusted origin in Okta. Navigate to **Security** > **API** and select the **Trusted Origins** tab. Select the **+ Add origin** button and add the following information:\n1. Use \"DPoP lab\" as the **Origin name**\n2. Paste your CodeSpace URL from the previous step as the **Origin URL**\n3. Choose **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** and **Redirect** as the types\n4. Select **Save**\n\nYour Okta org has an OIDC application pre-created for this lab. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and find the Okta OIDC app with \"DPoP\" in the name. Select the app to open the configuration.\n\nIn the **General** tab, select the **Edit** button under **General Settings** to make the following changes:\n\n1. Navigate to **Login** section\n2. Add the Codespace URL into the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field. Add `/login/callback` to the URL. It should look like `https://$CODESPACE_NAME-4200.app.github.dev/login/callback`.\n3. Add the URL for your Codespace in the **Sign-out redirect URIs** input by pasting the URL. \n4. **Save** your changes. Notice you don't have DPoP enabled yet.\n5. Navigate to the **Client Credentials** section. Copy the **Client ID**. You can use the clipboard button to copy the Client ID to your clipboard automatically.\n\nWe're all done with the Okta configuration for now. Leave this tab up, we'll be returning to it later in the lab.\n",

The `OktaConfig` object property should look something like `issuer: '0oabapji';`\n2. Replace `{yourOktaDomain}` value with the URL for your Okta training org.

Run the command `npm start` in the new terminal.\n\nThe app needs to be visible to Okta to complete the sign-in process:\n1.
